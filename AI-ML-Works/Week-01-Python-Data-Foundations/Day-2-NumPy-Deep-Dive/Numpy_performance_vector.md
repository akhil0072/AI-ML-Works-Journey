Lesson 8: NumPy Performance & Vectorization (Week 1, Day 2)To prep for Linear Regression, you must master Vectorization. In FAANG-level coding, we avoid for loops because they are slow in Python.The Concept: Why Vectorization?In standard Python, a loop processes one element at a time. In NumPy, Vectorization allows operations to be performed on entire arrays at once by leveraging highly optimized C and Fortran code under the hood. This is known as SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data).The Math: Dot ProductWhen we calculate a Linear Regression prediction $\hat{y}$, we use the dot product of weights ($w$) and features ($x$):$$\hat{y} = \mathbf{w} \cdot \mathbf{x} + b$$
